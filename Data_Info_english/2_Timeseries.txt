Additional information regarding the time series.

1. Unit of runoff data is m3/s. Conversion to runoff heights can be performed using the catchment area provided (attribute “area_gov” in Appendix A of the accompanying paper). 
   The units of the meteorological time series can be obtained from Appendix A of the accompanying paper, while the units of the fluxes of the hydrological model are noted in Appendix C.
2. The timezone for all time series is UTC (no summer time).
3. One value of the hourly time series represents the mean or sum from the indexed hour to the next following hour, 
   i.e. the value at 00:00 indicates the mean or sum from 00:00 to 01:00.
4. The folder "D_gauges/2_timeseries/gaps" contains the timesteps with no runoff data before interpolation.
   The maximum gap number for interpolation was set to 6. Remaining gaps are indicated in the provided runoff time series by the number -999.
   The meteorological time series have no gaps.
